# The-NeedleDrop
In this project, I will use Python with Jupyter Notebooks to build a dataset containing every album reviewed by Anthony Fantano on the YouTube channel "The NeedleDrop". This data will be correlated with album/song features, analyses and other data pulled from the Spotify API. I will then use this data to attempt to train a Machine Learning model to predict review scores by Anthony Fantano.

### Structure
The *ipynb* file are where I have done most of my data science work to collect, manage, and model the data.
The *py* files are classes used to organize the data behind the scenes.
Finally, *all_needledrop_ratings.csv* is the original data set I used to build my data set. It simply includes album names and Anthony's score.
*needledrop_data.csv* is the actual data set that I have built
